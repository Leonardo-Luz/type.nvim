## ISSUES

* **Widow toggle inaccuracy:** The WPM calculation is incorrect when the window is toggled multiple times
* **Backspace ineffectiveness:** Backspacing does not update the WPM, streak, correct word count, or incorrect word count statistics.
* **Incorrect WPM increase:** The WPM increases even when incorrect words are typed.
